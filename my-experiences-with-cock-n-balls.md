I was bored in my history class, we were essentially doing nothing, so I took my Pencil and Started Coding A Cock-n-Balls Calculator Right Away. (pls dont judge me)

The Below Blogpost is Just A Fun Hilarious Little Joke, It’s Funny and Impressive, Go Through it Once. It’s For Testing My New Github Repository with a Jekyll Theme.

### !! SUBJECTIVE HUMOR: VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED !!

## The Idea

`coding` is a vague term, It’s Deep, and Vast. The Thing is, With The Availability of Internet, There isn’t a software or a program you can’t code (in turing complete languages ofc)
What I mean by coding, is first, thinking of the problem. There Indeed was A Problem, It Was My Inability To Measure The Volume of My Cock And Balls. I could do it on paper, But That’s Obviously Boring, And Maths Too, is Boring. This Simple Problem, developed the Idea of Cock And Balls Calculator, “The Human Cock, is Divided into 2 Parts, Cylinder, and Cone.” I thought to myself.
”Couldn’t I just Use Archimedes’ Principle?” Another Intrusive Thought Hopped On. This Might Get Confusing. The Idea itself was so Awkward and Absurd that It Was Intriguing, I was Thrilled and Overjoyed that An idea Like this Could Ever Cross My Mortal Brain. I had decided it. My Life Goal Would Be To Create An Idea so Impeccable That It would be Used As A Biometric System by Men All Around The World. I would be using it, YOU would be using It, WE ALL WOULD BE USING IT.

## The Research

I am an Independent Researcher and A Very Responsible Developer, I knew, this Project Would be Incomplete without any Proper Research. With This Goal in Mind, I delved into the world of cock-n-balls, measuring techniques, and mathematical formulas. I studied various Different Cock-n-balls, and Developed A Ne-UwU-ral Network, Its Main Motive was To Differentiate and Develop A Solution so Foolproof, It Could Never Be Defeated.

I found myself in a sea of scientific jargon, trying to wrap my head around terms like circumference, diameter, and volume. Let's just say that I never imagined I would be Googling these terms in my entire career as a developer! The sheer absurdity of it all had me giggling 24 Days An Hour, 365 Days A Week, 52 Years A Month.

## The Challenge

As I started coding the calculator, I quickly realized that I had underestimated the challenges that lay ahead. It wasn't just a matter of plugging in some numbers and getting the desired results. Oh no, it was much more complicated than that! I found myself scratching my head trying to figure out how to calculate the volume of a cone and a cylinder, and how to incorporate balls into the equation. Who knew that math could be so "balls-y" (cmon thats funny) and confusing at the same time? It was a test of my coding skills and my sanity!

This Wasn’t Just A Small Fun Little Coding Challenge, This Was A Test Of My Endurance. This Was A Test of My Will To Partake. This Time, I was going To Stick through It. and stick through it I did.

## The Testing

Since I identify as a programmer, and Have Basically None IRL Friends, I went to the Ultimate Cesspool of Creeps Like Me, Discord. Discord Has All Type Of People, And When You Ask Them to measure their size and Input it into a totally not-so-suspicious website, They Do It For You. They Pulled it Through For Me, My Dear Friends On Discord, God Bless Your Soul. Thanks For Being An Important Testing Tools, Although My Cock and Balls have more volume of all of your tester’s combined. Ahahaha. (evil laughter)

## The Result

After weeks of hard work, countless hours of research, and more math than I ever thought possible, I finally had a working prototype of the Cock-n-Balls calculator. It was a thing of beauty, a true masterpiece. I could measure the volume of my manhood with ease, and it was accurate to within a fraction of a milliliter. I knew that I had achieved something truly special with this project.

## The Aftermath

Of course, not everyone was as enthusiastic about my creation as I was. Some people found it offensive, while others simply thought it was stupid. But I didn't let their negativity get me down. I knew that I had created something unique and valuable, and I was proud of it. And who knows, maybe one day my Cock-n-Balls calculator will be used by men all around the world to measure their manhood. A man can dream, can't he?

# Thanks For Visiting. Ciao!
